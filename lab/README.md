# Introduction to RNA-seq

We are going to use R in our lab. I recommend going through most of [this](https://billpetti.github.io/Crash_course_in_R/) R crushing course as it will help you feel more comfortable with the code presented in the lab.

## Installation
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org); 
- [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com);

Also, install the following R packages before the lab (follow the instructions provided in the package page):
- [deseq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html);
- [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html);
- [limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html);
- [gplots](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gplots/versions/3.1.1).
